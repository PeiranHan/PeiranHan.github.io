title:  Train Timetable Resilience Evaluation Method for High-speed Railway
event: World Transport Convention(WTC2023)

location: Chine Optics Valley Convention&Exibition Center, Wuhan, Hubei, China

summary: An oral presentation in WTC2023

abstract: 'The internal and external disturbance/disruption can seriously affect on-line performance of train timetable, so quantifying the robustness of timetable has a profound impact on high-speed railway operation. With the concept and its influencing factors, a scenario-based comprehensive evaluation framework, the optimization approach for  timetable structure and slack time is addressed to evaluate and enhance robustness.'

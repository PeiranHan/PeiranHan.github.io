title:  Integrated Train Makeup and Resource Planning in Railroad Shunting Yards
event: The International Conference on Optimization and Decision Science(ODS2023)

  city: Ischia, Italy

summary: A oral presentation in ODS2023(As a contributor)

abstract: 'The dwell time of freight trains is usually uncertain, and the bu-reau dispatcher usually has no knowledge of the progress of yard operations until trains are assembled at the departure bowl. The rea-son for this phenomenon is the complexity of yard operations. A valid yard plan pairs all initially parked blocks at the classification bowl, as well as all trains or blocks that arrive during the day, with compatible departures train. Furthermore, a feasible solution must be assigned to operation in conﬂict-free and resources-available manner. 
In a shunting yard, different types of operations bring changes of the train itself. Furthermore, the movement of trains in different statuses within the yard requires the assistance of shunting engines. Finally, the corresponding locomotive is also required for entering or departing the yard. Therefore, the “multi-state” of train and block in the yard need to be defined.
In a global network, different types of rail flows move between multiple yards and accomplish status transitions. These rail flows have complex coupling within the yard. To characterize that, we propose a three-layer time-space network to represent adequately consolidation activities proper to railroad transportation, railcars into blocks and blocks into trains, as well as the three types of rail ﬂows movements, namely, railcars, blocks and trains.
This research can significantly improve the efficiency of rail freight dispatching, collaborative optimize freight operations of node (yard) and edge (mainline) allows for more efficient use of the capac-ity in the global railway network. In specific rail freight facilities, the uncertainty and randomness of operations can be described in more detail, bottlenecks of shunting process, and scarcity of resources can be identified. Micro-operations at the yard can be described in a macro perspective. It will also provide a novel and efﬁcient approach to addressing the consolidation and decomposition nature of railways.'

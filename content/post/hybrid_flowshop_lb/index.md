title: 'Lower Bounds for Hybrid Flow Shop Scheduling Problem'

summary: Some simple LB for HFS
---


Assumption:
- Release time of each job = 0
- No due date 
- In each stage, the amount of processing machines is the same, equal to 2

```python
# We use the data from the reference[1]
job_data = [
    [3, 5, 9],
    [7, 1, 4],
    [2, 7, 4],
    [8, 2, 2],
    [6, 3, 7]
]
```

#### 1. Makespan-Based Lower bound
The first lower bound is quite simple, which is based on the critical path theory.
The entire set of jobs can finish no sooner than the total processing time for the longest-duration job. Thus, we have the following as a makespan lower bound:

```python
total_processing_times = [sum(jobs) for jobs in job_data]

makespan_lowerbound = max(total_processing_times)
```

#### 2. Stage-Based Lower bound
The second lower bound is the stage-based lower bound, it is a concept to derive the lower bound from each stage separately considering the bounds of parallel machines.

```python
import math

# we define a function of equation(4) in ref[1]
def stage_lb(list1, list2, list3, k):
    combined_sums = [x + y for x, y in zip(list2, list3)]

    min_value = min(combined_sums)
    combined_sums.remove(min_value)  # remove the minimum one
    second_min_value = min(combined_sums)  

    iso_sum = sum(list1)
    return 1/k*(iso_sum + min_value + second_min_value)

# Transfer the data
list1 = [item[0] for item in job_data]
list2 = [item[1] for item in job_data]
list3 = [item[2] for item in job_data]

k=2  # In each stage, we have 2 parallel processing machines.

# For each stage, we haveï¼š
stage_based_lowerbound1 = math.ceil(stage_lb(list1, list2, list3,k))
stage_based_lowerbound2 = math.ceil(stage_lb(list2, list1, list3,k))
stage_based_lowerbound3 = math.ceil(stage_lb(list3, list2, list1,k))

print("Stage 1 lower bound:", stage_based_lowerbound1)
print("Stage 2 lower bound:", stage_based_lowerbound2)
print("Stage 3 lower bound:", stage_based_lowerbound3)
print("Makespan lower bound:", makespan_lowerbound)
```

    Stage 1 lower bound: 18
    Stage 2 lower bound: 17
    Stage 3 lower bound: 21
    Makespan lower bound: 17

Makespan = 21 is the optimal value of the problem, which has been proved in Ref <sup>[2]<sup>

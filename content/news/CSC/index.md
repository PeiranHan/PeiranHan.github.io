I am delighted to announce that I have been accepted into the **Joint Ph.D. program** with funding from the China Scholarship Council (CSC). The visiting institute is the [Chair of Railway Operation](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/verkehr/ibv/bahnsysteme), which belongs to the 'Friedrich List' Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences at TU Dresden, under the supervision of Prof. Nikola Bešinović.

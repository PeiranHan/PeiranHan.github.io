I am honored to have the opportunity to serve as a 2025 PR officer for the INFORMS Railway Applications Section (RAS). RAS is a vibrant community that brings together researchers and practitioners working on railway operations, optimization, and analytics.

I look forward to contributing to the section, learning from others, and collaborating with fellow members to support RAS initiatives. There is so much exciting work being done in this field, and I hope to play a small part in fostering discussions and knowledge sharing.

I appreciate the trust of the community and am eager to engage with everyone in the coming year!
